存取控制 (英語：Access control)

In the fields of physical security and information security, access control (AC) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource[1]
while access management describes the process. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
Locks and login credentials are two analogous mechanisms of access control.
